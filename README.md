I created a google site in 2016. It was a good idea but I didnt 
add stuff regularly and it fell by the wayside

Fast forward to 2020. Google updated sites and I dont like the 
new update so I deleted that site and moved it all here.

Luckily there werent many pages so the process was painless. 
I will go back and check the spacing later just so that its 
easier to read

The main point to takeaway is I was writing like this in 2016.
I would write some code differently if I did it now.
